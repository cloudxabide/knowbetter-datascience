# Tools and Libraries
I tend to focus on the FOSS solutions first, as you will see.  That said, I am not weary/opposed of the proprietary vendor solutions.

## Libraries

## R Overview
* Statistical programming language
* for data processing and manipulation
* Statistical, Data 
* can use data from: flat files, Databases, Web, Stats software
* can do visualization
* RStudio - IDE to run R
